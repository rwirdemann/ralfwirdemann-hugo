+++

I am a software developer based in Hamburg. Currently, I specialize in embedded IoT development in [Go](https://go.dev). I have been working on Go projects since 2016 and have worked for major companies such as [Volkswagen](https://www.volkswagen.de), [Jungheinrich](https://www.jungheinrich.de), and [E.ON Grid Solutions](https://www.eon-gridsolutions.com/de.html). Prior to my specialization in Go, I primarily programmed in Java and Ruby. Additionally, I possess a strong background in software design and architecture.

I am one of the founders of [CodeKeepers GmbH](https://codekeepers.de), a company that is specialized in analyzing, maintaining, and modernizing legacy software.

Apart from work, I am a wingfoiler, spending my weekends in search of wind and waves at the Baltic Sea and Denmark.
