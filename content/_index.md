My name is Ralf Wirdemann, and I am an experienced software developer based in Hamburg. Currently, I specialize in embedded IoT development in [Go](https://go.dev). I have been working on Go projects since 2016 and have worked for major companies such as [Volkswagen](https://www.volkswagen.de), [Jungheinrich](https://www.jungheinrich.de), and [E.ON Grid Solutions](https://www.eon-gridsolutions.com/de.html). Prior to my specialization in Go, I primarily programmed in Java and Ruby. Additionally, I possess a strong background in software design and architecture.
